# Python_Simulations

In this repository I upload projects simulating different real-life processes.

Projects: 

  1. Falling Particle 
        - with and without air-resistance 
        - using Euler-scheme and Euler-Richardson-algorithm 
        - comparing results to analytical solutions
  2. Classical Helium Atom 
        -  Three body problem with fixed nucleus with two electrons
        -  using Euler-scheme and Euler-Richardson-algorithm
  3. Traffic Simulation
        - using Nagel-Schreckenberg model to simulate 
        - Cellular Automata 

Over the course of the projects  the difficulty increases.
The simulations are all written in Jupyter Notebooks and the code is in Python.
To illustrate the simulations many graphs and some animations are added.
